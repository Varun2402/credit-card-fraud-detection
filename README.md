# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project is an **end-to-end implementation** of a **Credit Card Fraud Detection system** built for my Final Year Project. It leverages advanced techniques like **XGBoost**, **SMOTE (for imbalanced data handling)**, and **feature scaling** to accurately identify fraudulent transactions from real-world data.

## Key Highlights

* Trained on a real-world dataset with 284,807 transactions
* Handled extreme class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
* Applied XGBoost classifier for high-performance fraud prediction
* Achieved ROC AUC Score: 0.98+ with precision and recall optimized for fraud cases
* Includes visualizations, confusion matrix, and classification report
* Structured for scalability and easy deployment
